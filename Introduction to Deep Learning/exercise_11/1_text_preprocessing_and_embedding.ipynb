In this exercise, we will play around with text instead of images as before, using Recurrent Neural Networks. Generally it is called Natural Language Processing (NLP) when dealing with text, speech, etc. But the data structure is very different to images, i.e. text is a string, while images consist of numbers. Hence, we need some preprocessing steps to transform raw text to another data format. This notebook will introduce these basic concepts in NLP pipelines. Specifically, you will learn about:\n","\n","1. How to preprocess text classification datasets\n","2.
