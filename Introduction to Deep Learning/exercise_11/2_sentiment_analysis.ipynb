But be careful, even if the previous notebook might seem to be a little bit boring, it is of great importance. We switched from images to text data in this exercise and remember the first steps that we did in our class were data related, too and they were essential for all the following exercises. So naturally, since we switched to text data in this exercie, make sure to have a good understanding of how the data has been prepared.\n","\n","For the last I2DL exercise, we want to make use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential data. We will stick with the same dataset that we have been looking at in the previous notebook, namely the [IMDb](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) sentiment analysis dataset that contains positive and negative movie reviews.\n","\n","<p class=\"aligncenter\">\n","    <img src=\"images/IMDB.jpg\" alt=\"centered image\" />\n","</p>\n","\n","Sentiment analysis is the task of predicting the sentiment of a text.
